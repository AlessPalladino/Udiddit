# Udiddit
Many of today’s most popular web applications have supporting database structures that allow them to customize and aggregate information within seconds. In this project, you will build the supporting data structures for Uddidit, a social media news aggregator site. First, you’ll investigate the provided data model for potential errors such as lack of normalization, consistency rules, and proper indexing. Then, you will create a new, normalized database using DDL based on the denormalized one that is provided. Lastly, you will write DML queries to migrate the data from the denormalized schema to their normalized schema.
